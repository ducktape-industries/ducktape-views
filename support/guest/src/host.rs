//! The guest's side of the request/response channel.
//!
//! [`request`] asks once and resolves on the first answer; [`subscribe`]
//! asks once and yields every answer until the host closes the stream. Both
//! hand the host a [`Request`] through the next frame. The guest never
//! blocks: the driver polls the app's tasks on every tick, so a task waiting
//! on the host simply stays pending until a response event arrives.
//!
//! [`notify`] is the third shape: it asks and never listens, for things whose
//! answer nobody wants ([`log`]).
//!
//! A request's `kind` is `<capability>.<operation>`. The host refuses a
//! capability the app's manifest did not declare, and the refusal arrives
//! as the `Err` of the answer — an ordinary error the app's handler routes.
